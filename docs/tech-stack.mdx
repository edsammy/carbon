# Tech Stack

Our tech stack aims to be as simple as possible, while still being powerful enough to build any web application. We use the following technologies:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) is the programming language
- [React](https://reactjs.org) for the frontend
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) for the UI components
- [Remix](https://remix.run) for the routing and compiling
- [Supabase](https://supabase.io) for the database and authentication

We also use [Redis](https://redis.io) for caching and [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for hosting, though in most cases you probably won't need those.

In this page, we'll give you a basic overview of how the tech stack works together. If you want to learn more about any of the technologies, we recommend checking out their documentation.

## TypeScript

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) is a programming language that builds on top of JavaScript. It adds a bunch of features that make it easier to write code, and it also makes it easier to catch bugs before you ship your code.

We chose TypeScript because it allows us to use a single, strongly-typed language across the entire application. Every time you run `npm run db:build`, we use Supabase to generate TypeScript types for your database schema.

## React

[React](https://reactjs.org) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's the most popular frontend framework in the world, and it's used by many of the biggest companies in the world, including Facebook, Netflix, and Airbnb.

We have a package called [@carbon/react](https://github.com/crbos/carbon/tree/main/packages/react/src) that has a bunch of React pre-built components that you can use to build your UI. You can also draw from a rich ecosystem of existing React component libraries.

## shadcn/ui

[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) is a collection of reusable components built using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. It provides accessibility, customization, and simplicity by combining Radix UI's unstyled, accessible components with Tailwind's utility-first CSS framework.

shadcn/ui gives us the best of both worlds: robust accessibility features from Radix UI primitives and complete design control through Tailwind CSS. Components are copy-and-paste friendly, meaning you own the code and can customize it however you need.

Here's an example of a shadcn/ui button:

There are a lot of other component libraries out there, but we chose Chakra UI because it gives us a lot of flexibility while providing great user and developer experience. We're hopeful that Chakra will implement Panda under the hood in v4, which will give us high-level performance. If we had time, we'd probably move everything over to Radix + Tailwind (assuming we could keep things super simple for the developer).

## Remix

[Remix](https://remix.run) is a framework for building full-stack web applications. It's built on top of React, and it allows us to co-locate server-side code and client-side code in the same files. When combined with TypeScript and Supabase, this gives us type-safety from the database to the UI.

Remix makes for a beautiful developer experience. It's use of nested routes, [loaders, actions and components](https://remix.run/blog/remix-data-flow) **minimizes the amount of code that needs written while maximzing performance**. To learn more about Remix, check out their documentation, and take a look at some files from our [routes](https://github.com/barbinbrad/carbon/tree/main/apps/carbon/app/routes) directory.

Here's a slightly-simplified example of how a Remix route works:

```tsx
// File (route): /products/$productId/edit.tsx

export async function loader({ params }) {
  const product = await getProduct(params.productId);
  return json(product);
}

export default function Route() {
  const product = useLoaderData();
  return (
    <h2>Edit Product {product.id}</h2>
    <Form method="post">
      <input name="name" defaultValue={product.name} />
      <input name="price" defaultValue={product.price} />
      <button type="submit">Save</button>
    </Form>
  )
}

export async function action({params, request}) {
  const form = await request.formData();
  const name = form.get("name");
  const price = form.get("price");
  const product = await database.updateProduct({ id: params.productId, name, price });
  return redirect(`/products/${product.id}`);
}
```

## Supabase

[Supabase](https://supabase.io) is a database, authentication, and storage service that's built on top of Postgres. It allows us to provide a simple, unified authentication layer across many applications (even those that don't exist yet).

Supabase provides a TypeScript client called [Supabase JS](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/typescript-support) that makes it incredibly easy to query/modify the database. It also makes it easy to use row-level security to restrict access to certain parts of the database on a per-user basis.

Here's a look at how you can use Supabase JS to query the database from a Remix loader where `client` is the supabase client specific to the user making the request:

```tsx
export async function loader({request}) {
  const { client } = requirePermissions(request, view: 'purchasing');
  const { data, error } = await client
    .from('purchaseOrder')
    .select(`
      id, name,
      customer(id, name),
      purchaseOrderItems(id, name, quantity, unitPrice, total)
    `)
    .order('createdAt', { ascending: false })
    .limit(10);

  if (error) {
```
